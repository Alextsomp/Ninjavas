## 📌About us
Routegenie originated as a collaborative endeavor within an academic setting during the third semester of the Programming II course, hosted by the Department of Management Science and Technology (DMST) at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB). This initiative was undertaken collectively by Ninjavas Team under the mentorship and supervision of Professor [Diomidis Spinellis](https://github.com/dspinellis), who offered guidance and oversight throughout the entirety of the project.

## 💡Why Routegenie?
While at first Routegenie was just a project for an academic assignment, it evolved and started meaning something for everyone involved in the team. It wasnt just a mean for a grade, but a full on challenge and passion for all of us. We worked hard to develop an application that facilitates the task of organizing a roadtrip to multiple cities, while providing our users a friendly interface to work with and ofcourse the best and most correct suggestions!


## 📋Description
Routegenie offers the flexibility to run in two distinct modes, allowing users to choose the interface that best suits their preferences and workflow. Whether you prefer the efficiency of _command-line interface (CLI)_ or the visual clarity of a _graphical user interface (GUI)_, Routegenie caters to your needs.
